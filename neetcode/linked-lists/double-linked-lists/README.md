| Access    | O(n)            | Need to traverse the list until the index is reached                      |
| Search    | O(n)            | Must traverse nodes one by one until the value is found                   |
| Insertion | O(1)            | Only if you already have a reference to the previous node; otherwise O(n) |
| Deletion  | O(1)            | Only if you already have a reference to the previous node; otherwise O(n) |
