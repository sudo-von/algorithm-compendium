# Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array

You are given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order. Your task is to remove duplicates from nums in-place so that each element appears only once.

After removing the duplicates, return the number of unique elements, denoted as k, such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements.

Note:

- The order of the unique elements should remain the same as in the original array.
- It is not necessary to consider elements beyond the first k positions of the array.
- To be accepted, the first k elements of nums must contain all the unique elements.

Return k as the final result.

Example 1:

```js
Input: nums = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4];

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4];
```

Explanation: You should return k = 4 as we have four unique elements.

Example 2:

```js
Input: nums = [2, 10, 10, 30, 30, 30];

Output: [2, 10, 30];
```

Explanation: You should return k = 3 as we have three unique elements.

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 30,000
- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
